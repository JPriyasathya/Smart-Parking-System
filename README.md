**🚗 Smart Parking System (Console-Based Java Project)**

**📌 Project Overview**
🎯 This Smart Parking System is a Java console application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) principles. It allows users to park vehicles, unpark vehicles, view real-time parking status, and exit the system via a simple text-based interface.


**✨ Features**
Park Vehicle 🚘
➡️ Park any vehicle (car/bike/truck) by entering vehicle type and number. Invalid inputs are handled with proper messages.

Unpark Vehicle 🅿️
➡️ Unpark by providing floor and slot numbers, with instant payment calculation and payment success confirmation.

Show Status 📊
➡️ View a full parking lot status with floors and slots showing either vehicle number or empty.

Exit System 🚪
➡️ Clean exit option from the program with no crashes or interruptions.

 
**🧩 OOPS Concepts Used**
✅ Encapsulation – Private fields with getter methods.
✅ Inheritance – Car, Bike, Truck extend Vehicle.
✅ Abstraction – Parking/unparking handled within dedicated classes.
✅ Class Interaction – Modular design with Main interacting with ParkingLot, Floor, Slot, Vehicle classes.


**🟣 Technologies Used**
